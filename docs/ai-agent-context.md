# AI Agent Context

**Service Purpose:** Acts as the guardian of LiveKit tokens within Decentraland's communication architecture. Processes signed fetch requests from clients and generates tokens that grant access to LiveKit rooms dedicated to specific scenes or worlds. Manages scene administration, streaming access, voice chat, and user moderation.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Issues LiveKit tokens** that are the mandatory credential for any client to enter the Genesis City platform and interact with other players — no token, no access
- Enforces **platform-level user bans at connection time**: banned users are rejected during token issuance and cannot re-enter any Genesis City room
- Generates secure LiveKit tokens for scene/world-specific communication rooms
- Manages scene administration (add/remove admins, ban users from individual scenes)
- Provides RTMP streaming URLs and keys for content creators
- Supports private voice chat sessions between users
- Implements community voice chat with speaker management and request-to-speak functionality
- Manages streaming access lifecycle with expiration and TTL
- Handles user privacy settings and access control
- Integrates with LiveKit webhooks for real-time event handling

**Communication Pattern:** Synchronous HTTP REST API with Signed Fetch authentication (ADR-44)

**Technology Stack:**

- Runtime: Node.js (LTS version)
- Language: TypeScript
- HTTP Framework: @dcl/http-server
- Database: PostgreSQL (via @well-known-components/pg-component)
- Communication: LiveKit Server SDK for token generation and room management
- Component Architecture: @well-known-components (logger, metrics, http-server, pg-component, env-config-provider)

**External Dependencies:**

- **LiveKit**: Real-time voice communication infrastructure for token generation and room management
- **PostgreSQL**: Scene administration, streaming access, voice chat users, and ban records
- **Catalyst**: Content server for scene metadata and validation
- **Places API**: Scene and place information
- **Social Service**: User relationships and social data
- **AWS SNS**: Event notifications for streaming and communication events

**Key Concepts:**

- **LiveKit Rooms**: Each scene/world gets a dedicated LiveKit room identified by a room name (e.g., `scene:realm:sceneId`)
- **Scene Administration**: Scene admins can manage access, ban users, and control streaming access
- **Streaming Access**: Content creators can request RTMP streaming URLs and keys for broadcasting to scenes
- **Voice Chat Types**:
  - Private voice chat: Direct communication between users
  - Community voice chat: Moderated group communication with speaker management
- **Request-to-Speak**: Users can request permission to speak in community voice chats
- **Streaming TTL**: Streaming access has time-to-live and expiration mechanisms
- **Scene Bans**: Users can be banned from specific scenes by scene admins
- **Platform Ban (global ban)**: A platform-level ban permanently blocks a user from obtaining any LiveKit token from comms-gatekeeper. Because a token is required to enter any Genesis City room, a platform-banned user is effectively excluded from all real-time interaction in Genesis City. Bans are stored in the `scene_bans` table (scene-scoped) and enforced synchronously at token issuance time — the request is rejected before any LiveKit call is made.

**Role in Genesis City Comms Access:**

The Comms Gatekeeper is the access authority for player-to-player interaction in Genesis City. Specifically:

- **LiveKit token as the mandatory platform credential**: A LiveKit token issued by comms-gatekeeper is the single required credential to enter the Genesis City platform. Without it, a client cannot join any room (scene room or island room) and therefore cannot see other players, hear voice, or exchange positional data. There is no alternative path — token issuance by comms-gatekeeper is the gate.
- **Scene rooms and island rooms**: Controls access to both scene-specific LiveKit rooms (tied to a particular scene/parcel) and island rooms (the dynamic clustering rooms managed by Archipelago). Both require a token from comms-gatekeeper.
- **The enforcement point for Genesis City interaction**: All ban checks, permission checks, and access-control decisions for real-time Genesis City interaction happen here, synchronously, before a token is issued.
- **Scoped to Genesis City**: The Comms Gatekeeper's role applies to Genesis City scenes and islands. For Worlds, the access control gatekeeper role is fulfilled by the Worlds Content Server, which may use a separate LiveKit account/cluster.

**Database Schema:**

- **Tables**: `scene_admin` (scene administrators), `scene_stream_access` (streaming URLs and keys), `scene_bans` (banned users), `voice_chat_users` (private voice chat participants), `community_voice_chat_users` (community voice chat with moderation)
- **Key Relationships**: Scene admins manage scenes, streaming access is per scene, bans are per scene, voice chat users are per room
- **Full Documentation**: See [docs/database-schemas.md](docs/database-schemas.md) for detailed schema, column definitions, and relationships

**API Specification:** Full OpenAPI 3.0 spec at [docs/openapi.yaml](docs/openapi.yaml). Endpoint groups:

- **Token issuance** (`/scene-adapter`, `/island-adapter`): generate LiveKit tokens for scene and island rooms — the primary entry point to the platform
- **Scene administration** (`/scene-admin`): add/remove scene admins
- **Moderation** (`/scene-bans`, `/platform-bans`): ban/unban users at scene scope or platform scope; platform-ban endpoints require elevated service credentials
- **Streaming** (`/scene-stream-access`): RTMP URL and key lifecycle for content creators
- **Voice chat** (`/private-voice-chat`, `/community-voice-chat`): session creation, speaker management, request-to-speak
- **Webhooks** (`/livekit-webhook`): receive LiveKit server events (room created/destroyed, participant joined/left)

**Authentication Notes:**

- Most endpoints require Signed Fetch authentication (ADR-44)
- Scene-based requests require scene metadata (sceneId, parcel, realmName) in identity headers
- Explorer-based requests use different identity header format
- Service-to-service communication uses Bearer tokens
