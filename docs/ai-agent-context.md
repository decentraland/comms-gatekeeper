# AI Agent Context

**Service Purpose:** Acts as the guardian of LiveKit tokens within Decentraland's communication architecture. Processes signed fetch requests from clients and generates tokens that grant access to LiveKit rooms dedicated to specific scenes or worlds. Manages scene administration, streaming access, voice chat, and user moderation.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Generates secure LiveKit tokens for scene/world-specific communication rooms
- Manages scene administration (add/remove admins, ban users)
- Provides RTMP streaming URLs and keys for content creators
- Supports private voice chat sessions between users
- Implements community voice chat with speaker management and request-to-speak functionality
- Manages streaming access lifecycle with expiration and TTL
- Handles user privacy settings and access control
- Integrates with LiveKit webhooks for real-time event handling

**Communication Pattern:** Synchronous HTTP REST API with Signed Fetch authentication (ADR-44)

**Technology Stack:**

- Runtime: Node.js (LTS version)
- Language: TypeScript
- HTTP Framework: @dcl/http-server
- Database: PostgreSQL (via @well-known-components/pg-component)
- Communication: LiveKit Server SDK for token generation and room management
- Component Architecture: @well-known-components (logger, metrics, http-server, pg-component, env-config-provider)

**External Dependencies:**

- **LiveKit**: Real-time voice communication infrastructure for token generation and room management
- **PostgreSQL**: Scene administration, streaming access, voice chat users, and ban records
- **Catalyst**: Content server for scene metadata and validation
- **Places API**: Scene and place information
- **Social Service**: User relationships and social data
- **AWS SNS**: Event notifications for streaming and communication events

**Key Concepts:**

- **LiveKit Rooms**: Each scene/world gets a dedicated LiveKit room identified by a room name (e.g., `scene:realm:sceneId`)
- **Scene Administration**: Scene admins can manage access, ban users, and control streaming access
- **Streaming Access**: Content creators can request RTMP streaming URLs and keys for broadcasting to scenes
- **Voice Chat Types**: 
  - Private voice chat: Direct communication between users
  - Community voice chat: Moderated group communication with speaker management
- **Request-to-Speak**: Users can request permission to speak in community voice chats
- **Streaming TTL**: Streaming access has time-to-live and expiration mechanisms
- **Scene Bans**: Users can be banned from specific scenes by scene admins

**Database Schema:**

- **Tables**: `scene_admin` (scene administrators), `scene_stream_access` (streaming URLs and keys), `scene_bans` (banned users), `voice_chat_users` (private voice chat participants), `community_voice_chat_users` (community voice chat with moderation)
- **Key Relationships**: Scene admins manage scenes, streaming access is per scene, bans are per scene, voice chat users are per room
- **Full Documentation**: See [docs/database-schemas.md](docs/database-schemas.md) for detailed schema, column definitions, and relationships

**API Specification:** OpenAPI docs available at [docs/openapi.yaml](docs/openapi.yaml)

**Authentication Notes:**

- Most endpoints require Signed Fetch authentication (ADR-44)
- Scene-based requests require scene metadata (sceneId, parcel, realmName) in identity headers
- Explorer-based requests use different identity header format
- Service-to-service communication uses Bearer tokens
